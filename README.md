# LinkedList

This repository consists of modularised code implemented to perform the basic operations like:
  1. Creating a linked list
  2. Inserting the node at the start
  3. Inserting the node at the end
  4. Inserting the node at a given postion
  5. Traversing the linked list
  6. Freeing all the memory explicitly allocated by the user on the heap storage
  7. Compiling the code through makefile
